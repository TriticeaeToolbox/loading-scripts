comment: Quality traits of a plant, plant structure or plant product vary from crop production to food consumption factors and may include organoleptic properties (flavor, aroma, appearance, texture, etc), storability, processing qualities and nutritional aspects. Market quality standards for crops are based on complex interaction of social, economic and biological factors and are highly crop-specific (Acquaah, 2012).\n\nPlant traits from other upper level classes may contribute to (as part_of children) to specific plant quality traits.
